Mila Deep Neural Network Library

## Prerelease Notice
Mila, version 0.9.69-alpha is currently an early, preview release.

## Description
Achilles Mila Deep Neural Network library provides a comprehensive API to model, train and evaluate 
Deep Neural Networks for both research and production environments. The library implements
state-of-the-art architectures including transformers, convolutional networks, and recurrent models.
Mila utilizes the NVIDIA CUDA runtime for high-performance GPU acceleration, enabling efficient
training and inference on large-scale datasets. The library also supports distributed training
across multiple GPUs and compute nodes, with automatic optimization for various hardware configurations.

## Top Features
1. Deep Neural Nets
   * GPT2, Recurrent Neural Networks
   * GPU acceleration using CUDA runtime

2. Datasets
   * Batch sequence loader
   * Optimized data processing pipelines

## What's New

* Improved CUDA error handling with detailed error messages and source location tracking
* Optimized tensor operations for device memory with single-element access
* Enhanced memory management for GPU tensors with efficient transfer operations
* Added comprehensive documentation with Doxygen comments
* Standardized naming conventions across the codebase
* Performance improvements for device-to-host and host-to-device memory transfers
* Expanded tensor API with better type safety and memory access patterns

## Mila Build Instructions
Mila uses CMake build. To build Mila, follow the steps below:  

1. Clone the Mila repository
- git clone https://github.com/toddthomson/mila.git cd mila

#### Using Visual Studio

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Visual Studio 2022 or newer with "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - CUDA Toolkit 12.8
   - CMake 3.31 or newer (included with Visual Studio)

2. **Open the Project**
   - Launch Visual Studio
   - Select "Open a local folder" and navigate to your cloned Mila repository
   - Visual Studio will automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file

3. **Configure Project**
   - Visual Studio will automatically generate CMake cache
   - To customize build settings, right-click on CMakeLists.txt and select "CMake Settings for MilaProject"
   - Under "Configuration type", select "Release" for optimal performance

4. **Build the Project**
   - Right-click on CMakeLists.txt and select "Build All"
   - Alternatively, use the Build menu or press F7

5. **Run Tests**
   - In the Solution Explorer, expand the "Tests" folder
   - Right-click on a test project and select "Run Tests"

#### Using Visual Studio Code

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Visual Studio Code
   - C/C++ extension
   - CMake Tools extension
   - CUDA Toolkit 12.8
   - CMake 3.31 or newer

2. **Open the Project**
   - Launch VS Code
   - Open the folder containing your cloned Mila repository
   - VS Code should detect the CMake project automatically

3. **Configure Project**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette
   - Type "CMake: Configure" and select it
   - Choose your preferred generator (Ninja is recommended for faster builds)
   - Select the build variant (Debug/Release)

4. **Build the Project**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette
   - Type "CMake: Build" and select it, or use the build button in the status bar

5. **Run Tests**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette
   - Type "CMake: Run Tests" and select it
   - Alternatively, use the Test Explorer extension to browse and run tests
