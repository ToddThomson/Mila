# Mila — Backlog

**Work committed to the release in flight, and nothing else.** Narrative and success criteria are in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); everything upstream of the commitment is in
[`Mila/Issues/`](Mila/Issues/README.md). Completed work is in the git history.

**Admission:** name the ROADMAP success criterion that fails if this never ships. If you cannot,
it belongs in `Mila/Issues/`.

Each `###` bucket is a v0.20 theme, its name matching the ROADMAP section — the only join.

**Entry shape**, one level deeper than the same shape in `Mila/Issues/`:

```markdown
#### Llama throws away its long-context scaling factor

`open` · `llama`

The load path reads `rope_scaling` from the model metadata and discards it — the
`.withRoPEScalingFactor()` call at `Llama.ixx:703` is commented out, for a reason recorded as
unclear. 3.1 8B cannot reach the context length it advertises.
```

The **heading states the problem** and has to read cold: no term that exists only inside Mila.
The **metadata line** carries status — `open`, `in progress`, `done` — then area tags from
[Tags.md](Mila/Issues/Tags.md); status never appears in the prose. The **body** carries whatever
detail the work needs and ends in an anchor, unless the finding is an absence, in which case say so
rather than inventing a location.

**The gate is the entry count, and it only goes down.** A release in flight burns down, so an
addition is paired with a removal or it is a deliberate admission that scope grew. Past roughly
forty entries this is a wishlist, not a release.

**Done means deleted**, in the same commit as the work — `done` is a working-tree marker and is
never committed.

## Current release (v0.20.0)

Empty. Every item committed to v0.20.0 has shipped; what remains is the release itself
([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). Findings that arrive now go to [`Mila/Issues/`](Mila/Issues/README.md).
