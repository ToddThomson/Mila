# Untriaged

Captured, not yet judged. Writing here needs no judgement, which is the whole point — finding
something mid-task leaves seconds, and a format that asks for more is a format that goes unused.
Facts may grow; judgement may not.

Entries are **deleted unexamined after ninety days**, and anything user-reported is a pointer to its
GitHub issue rather than a copy. Triage flow, categories and the entry format are in
[README.md](README.md); entries here carry an anchor where the judged files carry tags.

## The Qwen 3.8 2.82-bit model card says "residency"

`Mila/Tools/ExportArtifact/ModelCards/Qwen3.8-27B-cb2-3/README.md:53` @ `539396e`

Found 2026-10-07 reading the cards' quality sections for the evaluation discussion. "The cost of the smaller
residency" -- a term `CLAUDE.md` lists as one only Mila uses. The section's numbers are also against Mila's own FP4
build, not the upstream model.

## Qwen 4 27B is expected around November 2026 and Mila has no Qwen 4 chassis

`Mila/Specifications/Qwen4.md` @ 539396e

Compared Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, the Qwen 4 architecture preview, against the Qwen 3.8 chassis and wrote the
spec. Its section 9 phases 0 to 2 (the tiny reference, the converter skeleton, grouped RmsNorm, dilated
CausalConv1d, the DeltaNet gate activation, and the gated residual, n-gram, PLE and QSA indexer components)
need no 27B checkpoint. 2026-10-08: Phases 0 and 1 are built and their CPU gates passed; Phase 2 has
`GatedResidual` and `NgramEmbedding` on CPU, gated against the tiny reference.
